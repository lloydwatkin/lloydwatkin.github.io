                <li>The great thing about the internet is that everyone is a publisher and the WWW + HTML has allowed for that</li>
                <li>But what happens when systems go away?</li>
                <li>e.g. geocities - a great loss (thankfully archived) of human thought http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities</li>
                <li>Kyle Drake's Neocities - website about hating carpets - what if this person goes on to invent time travel?</li>
                <li>Its a large historical archive - what is worthless today may be priceless in future - e.g. Egyptian worker grafitti</li>
                <li>What happens when a company gets bought up and your site no longer matches their terms?</li>

                <li>Like many of you, I use a certain social network</li>
                <li>I put my memories on there talk about, and share, experiences - we share an awful lot about ourselves</li>
                <li>What happens when that social network goes away? Or decides to trim its database?</li>
                <li>Treasured memories will be lost - relationships, friends, family, pets, children</li>
                <li>Sure may be you can export your data, but you'll never get it in the same form</li>
                <li>Worse still what if they decided to censor posts on certain topics (e.g. Palestine) or 
                decided to experiment with its users on a psychological level? http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds</li>

            <li>What if provider "A" decided to replace IMAP?</li>
            <li>Every system involving email, now has to support this new protocol</li>
            <li>Writing systems becomes more expensive, more error prone</li>
            <li>Each time the new API is updated new code has to be written, systems have to be updated</li>
            <li>What happens if they then only allow internal email (compuserve &amp; AOL of the past)</li>
